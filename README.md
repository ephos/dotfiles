# My Dots

How I ended up here.

- I found `chezmoi` extremely annoying to use.
  * I don't want to manage numerous templates for small differences in something like a Hyprland/sway/i3 config.
- I need to manage similar yet different files between my desktop and laptop.
  * I found the [bare git repository] to be super annoying for managing differences.

I started here and ended up back here.  

- _common_ for shared files
- _desktop_ for desktop specific configs
- _laptop_ for laptop specific configs

A simple script will just automatically sync things where they need to be synced. 

Simple. Done.  No more non-sense with solutions in search of problems.
